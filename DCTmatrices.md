#### Without going into deep academic

Some investigations on how to understand the DCT- and inverse DCT, as it is used in different image- and video Decoder Standards. During some work on writing decoders in C for JPEG, MPEG, HEVC (AVC defines its own transform, there is nothing else to do there), I had to wrap my head around this many times and write code for computing the transform efficiently. Here we look at different order-2<sup>n</sup> DCT matrices with some spreadsheet help.

I've written some more text about this, get the <a href="Little about the DCT.pdf">Little about the DCT.pdf</a> for full text and the [Excel sheet"Little about the DCT.xls"] for the calculations.
